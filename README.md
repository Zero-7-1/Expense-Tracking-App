
<h2> While Testing the Project: </h2>

This project is a simple hobby project created as part of my learning journey to enhance 
my skills in web development. The deployment leverages free trials and services offered 
by various platforms.

Please note that due to the limitations of free-tier plans, you might experience occasional 
delays or slower response times from the backend server. Despite these constraints, this 
setup effectively demonstrates the application's core features and functionality. Also I am
constantly working on changes and improvements so current version would be improved. 


<h2> Logging in: </h2> 

This application uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage all login credentials. 
Please note that since this is a learning project and not a professional app, login 
credentials and any data entered into the app will be periodically removed.

I appreciate your understanding and hope you enjoy exploring the project!
